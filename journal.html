        <li>Magic City, ID, </li>
        <li>Bountiful, UT</li>

    I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today: 

    <blockquote>"Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity."</blockquote>

    I definitely won't be passing any cars.

    <p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cell phone, iPod, digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, </p>

    <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.<q>
